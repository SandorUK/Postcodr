Postcodr
==============

What is this app about?
--------------

It is so often happens that you need to know exactly that pesky postcode: either you are ordering something from the web or just would like to know which part of London you are in, everything you need is that magic combination of letters and numbers. 
This app does the magic. You will get the exact postcode of your location!

Why did I make it?
--------------

The main idea was to create a small showcase app in which I can use the following technologies:

- RESTful webservices
- CoreData
- UI Transition API
- CoreAnimation
- Location Services
- AutoLayout

Project is commented well enough and has unit tests for it's logic layer.
